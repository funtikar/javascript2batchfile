# script2batchfile
A toy javascript to Windows batch file transpiler.


This is a python translator from a JavaScript inspired scripting language to the Windows batch file language.
I initiated this project to avoid the hassle of remembering the quirks of how Windows batch files work
whenever I need them.

I encourage you to take part in making this better especially if you have the same vision as mine. :D
