# script2batchfile
A toy scripting language to Windows batch file translator.


This is a python translator from a JavaScript/BASIC inspired scripting language to the Windows batch file language.
I initiated this project to prevent myself from running into to the quirks to remember how Windows batch files work
whenever I need them.

I encourage you to take part in making this better especially if you have the same vision as mine. :D
